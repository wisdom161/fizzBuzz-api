## Back End Challenge - FizzBuzz API

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs dependencies.

### `npm start`

Starts the local server.<br>

-Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

-Or use a tool such as [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to interact with the API

### `http://127.0.0.1:3000/?m=&n=`
Enter inputs for m and n to query the endpoint and interact with the fizzBuzz controller.

ex: http://127.0.0.1:3000/?m=1&n=20

Valid inputs will send a response back in a JSON that has a string representation of numbers from m to n, however for multiples of three - it should output "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five, the output should be "Buzz".

Numbers that are multiples of both three and five should output "FizzBuzz".

Spend some time testing any edge cases for queries that are not valid!
